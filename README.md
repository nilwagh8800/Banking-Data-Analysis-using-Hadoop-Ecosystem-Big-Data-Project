## Banking Data Analysis using Hadoop Ecosystem â€“ Big Data Project
Technologies: HDFS, MapReduce (Python), Hive, HiveQL

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing large-scale banking datasets using Big Data technologies to uncover insights that drive marketing and risk management decisions.

## Key Contributions:
Data Ingestion & Transformation:
Ingested and processed massive banking datasets using HDFS, and developed Python MapReduce programs to:

Compute job-wise average account balances

Perform housing loan segmentation

Extract insights from campaign engagement metrics

## Advanced Analytics with HiveQL:
Executed complex queries and statistical analysis using HiveQL, enabling:

Identification of Top 5 job categories with the highest average balances and subscription rates

Correlation analysis between client age and account balance

Campaign outcome evaluation (poutcome) and monthly success rate insights

Anomaly detection using z-score method across education levels

Year-over-year trend analysis and comparison of average contact durations by subscription outcome to optimize marketing strategies

## Outcome:
The project demonstrated how distributed computing and big data tools can uncover actionable insights in banking data, helping enhance customer targeting, campaign effectiveness, and risk assessment.
